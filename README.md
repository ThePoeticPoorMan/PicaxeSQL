A clone of SQLite/SQL made in Dart with the purpose of simplifying SQL to it's extreme

### Description

This is just a simple clone of SQLite meant to simplify SQL (mainly because i'm dumb
and cannot make a SQL-Based DBMS). This is helping me a lot in my quest to learn OOP-based 
programming languages since Dart ain't as complicated as C++, as heavy as Java, as simple 
as and Python and Java since it can compile to machine code or transpile to C++.

### Disclaimer

DO NOT use this for any comercial or serious activities, my code is BS and it will probably fail at some point.

IF you can even read it, i'm pround of you.
